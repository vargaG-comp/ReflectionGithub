Im from New mexico, so I went to Santa Teresa High School. The
city Im from is right at the border of Mexico and Texas. Im half hispanic 
so moving over here I miss being surrounded by Hispanic food, Hispanic culture,
and all of my friends and family. I moved to Rochester because RIT gave me the 
best oppurtunity for my career and education. I think with all of my classes my top 
hardest is Calculus and Microeconomics. Some hobbies I have is to listen to music, 
watch movies, running, playing basketball, and going on walks. 


Some things I want to learn from this course
- What being a Software Engineer could be like in expected years?
- Where are the best places to get connections as a Software Engineer?
- What I can do to help get me to where I want to be in my career
